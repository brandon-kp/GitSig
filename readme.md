# GitSig

GitSig is intended as a forum signature image to display your basic stats from 
GitHub (repos, followers, etc.)

You can use it by linking to /path/to/script/**username**.png

Though, it isn't really built for direct linking, but just to build the image, 
which you can save, and then link to, as generating the image for every hit 
could potentially be a considerable strain on your server.
